There are n teams numbered from 0 to n - 1 in a tournament; each team is also a node in a DAG.

You are given the integer n and a 0-indexed 2D integer array edges of length m representing the DAG, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is a directed edge from team ui to team vi in the graph.

A directed edge from a to b in the graph means that team a is stronger than team b and team b is weaker than team a.

Team a will be the champion of the tournament if there is no team b that is stronger than team a.

Return the team that will be the champion of the tournament if there is a unique champion, otherwise, return -1.
